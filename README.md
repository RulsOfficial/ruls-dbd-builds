# Rul's DBD Builds

Website dedicated to **storing** and **showcasing** my Dead by Daylight builds.

This project is heavily inspired by [Mr.Tipson's repository](https://github.com/MrTipson/otz-builds), from which **styles** and **aesthetics** were taken. His work was also key for scrapping the info about **perks** and **characters**.


## Customization

- By modifying the **`survivor-builds.json`** and **`killer-builds.json`** files, you can add your own builds.  
- In **`survivor-groups.json`** you can create groups to organize survivor builds by categories.


## Update

1. Open a **codespace** of the repository.  
2. Run the following command:  
   ```bash
   chmod +x update.sh ; ./update.sh
